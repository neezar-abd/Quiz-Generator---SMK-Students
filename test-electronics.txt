Introduction to Basic Electronics

Electronics is a fundamental subject in SMK (Vocational High School) programs. This document covers essential concepts that students need to understand.

Chapter 1: Basic Components
Electronic circuits are built using various components such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Each component has specific properties and functions.

Resistors control the flow of electric current in a circuit. They are measured in ohms and follow Ohm's law, which states that voltage equals current multiplied by resistance (V = I Ã— R).

Capacitors store electrical energy in an electric field. They are used for filtering, timing circuits, and energy storage applications.

Inductors store energy in a magnetic field when current flows through them. They are commonly used in power supplies and filtering applications.

Chapter 2: Basic Laws
Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) states that the sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node.

Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states that the sum of voltages around any closed loop in a circuit equals zero.

These laws are fundamental to circuit analysis and are essential for understanding complex electronic systems.

Chapter 3: Practical Applications
Electronic circuits are found in many everyday devices including smartphones, computers, and household appliances. Understanding basic electronics helps in troubleshooting and maintenance of these devices.

Safety is paramount when working with electronics. Always follow proper safety procedures and use appropriate protective equipment.

This concludes the introduction to basic electronics for SMK students.
